# Some fan_speed value are ignored by laptops, they will trigger the closest valid RPM speed.
# The RPM value displayed by option -r is not exact but close (+-50RPM).
# fan_mode can be 140, 76 or 12, for Advanced, Basic or Auto. Advanced seems to work better with suspend/hibernate.
# cooler_boost seems to be triggered by any value >= 128.
#
# You can find a better explanation of how ec work at:
# https://github.com/YoyPa/isw/wiki/How-EC-work-(for-GS40-6QE-at-least)
#
# You can help me support your laptop (mainly MSI) by openning an issue and providing 'isw -cp MSI_ADDRESS_DEFAULT' output.
# Make sure your dump is made before altering EC with isw, you can reset your EC with a reboot or by changing power source.
